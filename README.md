# 171_movie_recommendation
Movie recommendation engine written for ECS171 Machine Learning.
This was part of a quarter long research project involving ten people. This is a reuploaded version of my contribution to the project since the original repo was taken down. Uses the small data set from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). 

Two collaborative filtering methods were used to generate recommendations: 
* SVD
* k-Nearest Neighbors with cosine similarity

### Instructions
Requires Python 3.6.6. Clone repository and run:
```
python main.py
```
