# 171_movie_recommendation
Movie recommendation engine written for ECS171 Machine Learning.
This was part of a quarter long research project involving ten people. 
Not included is our fifteen page research-styled report and the front-end GUI to create recommendations based on user-inputted movies.
This is a reuploaded version of my contribution to the project since the original repo was taken down.

Two collaborative filtering methods were used to generate recommendations: 
* SVD
* k-Nearest Neighbors with cosine similarity
